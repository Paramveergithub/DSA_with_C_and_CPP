1 to 70 days       => 70 * 5 = 350 Questions   -> 5 Questions / day.
71 to 140 days     => 70 * 2 = 140 Questions   -> 2 Questions / day.
141 to 365 days    => 225 * 1 = 225 Questions  -> 1 Question / day.

366 to 730         => 365 * 1 = 365 Questions  -> 1 Question / day.

Total Questions => 715 + 365 = 1080 Questions is my GOAL.
